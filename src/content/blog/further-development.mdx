Hey everyone, I'm excited to share my plans for developing the website further. There's a lot to work on

## Features to be implemented in the future

One of the most important things is adding the static content on the website.
It can be done using the [contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev) library and **MDX**.

### 1. Support

Adding the support pages - ["/about"](/about), ["/terms"](/terms), ["/privacy"](/privacy) and ["/contact"](/contact)

### 2. Explore page

In the explore page users can visit the articles page or our blog. They can quickly find some interesting news or announcements and visit the content they want to see.
I want this page to be really user-friendly by ading a fresh design.

### 3. Blog

We will be annoucing news and sharing our progress, talk about how we're developing the community of our school.
Also I will be sharing the website development process.

### 4. Authors page

We already have the authors page, but to be honest it's really boring. So, I'm going to add some cool design and details.
Then users can visit each author's page on "/author/[username]".
They can personalize their page with info about themselves and showcase their articles.

## Development process and progress

For editor and article rendering I'm using the react-markdown library.

```tsx
import ReactMarkdown from "react-markdown";

interface MarkdownProps {
  source: string;
}

export function Markdown({ source }: MarkdownProps) {
  return (
    <div className="prose overflow-hidden dark:prose-invert">
      <ReactMarkdown
        components={components}
        // Here I've added the github flavored markdown
        // Also I've added the remark-breaks plugin
        // Instead of adding two whitespaces at the end of the line to break
        // You only need to hit Enter key (\n)
        remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm, remarkBreaks]}
        rehypePlugins={[
          rehypeSlug,
          // Here I've added the rehype-highlight library
          // It adds syntax highlighting
          // The readon why I didn't add the rehype-pretty-code instead is
          // rehype-pretty-code library is async
          // which means I can't render it client-side for editor preview
          rehypeHighlight,
          [
            rehypeAutolinkHeadings,
            {
              properties: {
                className: ["subheading-anchor"],
                ariaLabel: "Link to section",
              },
            },
          ],
        ]}
      >
        {source}
      </ReactMarkdown>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Currently I have already added the support and blog pages.
I'm using the contentlayer to add static content.

Here you can see the config of contentlayer

```ts
import {
  defineDocumentType,
  makeSource,
  type ComputedFields,
} from "contentlayer/source-files";
import rehypeAutolinkHeadings from "rehype-autolink-headings";
import rehypePrettyCode from "rehype-pretty-code";
import rehypeSlug from "rehype-slug";
import remarkGfm from "remark-gfm";

const computedFields: ComputedFields = {
  slug: {
    type: "string",
    resolve: (doc) => `/${doc._raw.flattenedPath}`,
  },
  slugAsParams: {
    type: "string",
    resolve: (doc) => doc._raw.flattenedPath.split("/").slice(1).join("/"),
  },
};

// defining document types

export const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: "Post",
  filePathPattern: `blog/**/*.mdx`,
  contentType: "mdx",
  fields: {
    title: {
      type: "string",
      required: true,
    },
    description: {
      type: "string",
    },
    date: {
      type: "date",
      required: true,
    },
    published: {
      type: "boolean",
      default: true,
    },
    image: {
      type: "string",
      required: true,
    },
    authors: {
      // Reference types are not embedded.
      // Until this is fixed, we can use a simple list.
      // type: "reference",
      // of: Author,
      type: "list",
      of: { type: "string" },
      required: true,
    },
  },
  computedFields,
}));

export const Author = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: "Author",
  filePathPattern: `authors/**/*.mdx`,
  contentType: "mdx",
  fields: {
    title: {
      type: "string",
      required: true,
    },
    description: {
      type: "string",
    },
    avatar: {
      type: "string",
      required: true,
    },
    instagram: {
      type: "string",
      required: true,
    },
  },
  computedFields,
}));

export const Page = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: "Page",
  filePathPattern: `pages/**/*.mdx`,
  contentType: "mdx",
  fields: {
    title: {
      type: "string",
      required: true,
    },
    description: {
      type: "string",
    },
  },
  computedFields,
}));

export default makeSource({
  contentDirPath: "./src/content",
  documentTypes: [Post, Author, Page],
  mdx: {
    // here I've added the github flavored markdown plugin
    // It adds task lists, tables, strikethroughs and other cool stuff
    remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
    rehypePlugins: [
      // here i've added the rehype pretty code plugin
      // It adds syntax-highlighting to code blocks
      [
        // @ts-expect-error - rehype-pretty-code types are not compatible with rehype plugins
        rehypePrettyCode,
        {
          theme: "github-dark",
        },
      ],
      // other rehype plugins for useful sutff
      rehypeAutolinkHeadings,
      rehypeSlug,
    ],
  },
});
```
