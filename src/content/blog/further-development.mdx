Hey everyone, I'm excited to share my plans for developing the website further. There's a lot to work on

## Features to be implemented in the future

One of the most important things is adding the static content on the website.
It can be done using the [contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev) library and **MDX**.

### 1. Support

Adding the support pages - ["/about"](/about), ["/terms"](/terms), ["/privacy"](/privacy) and ["/contact"](/contact)

### 2. Explore page

In the explore page users can visit the articles page or our blog. They can quickly find some interesting news or announcements and visit the content they want to see.
I want this page to be really user-friendly by ading a fresh design.

### 3. Blog

We will be annoucing news and sharing our progress, talk about how we're developing the community of our school.
Also I will be sharing the website development process.

### 4. Authors page

We already have the authors page, but to be honest it's really boring. So, I'm going to add some cool design and details.
Then users can visit each author's page on "/author/[username]".
They can personalize their page with info about themselves and showcase their articles.

## Development process and progress

For editor and article rendering I'm using the react-markdown library.

Currently I have already added the support and blog pages.
I'm using the contentlayer to add static content.
